"""Compact the OneLake Iceberg catalog's data files (post-load maintenance).

Every model in this project is an insert-only incremental merge — that is deliberate
(OneLake accepts one add-snapshot per commit), but it means each dbt run appends another
small data file per table and nothing ever folds them back together. This runs
iceberg_rewrite_data_files() over each table, consolidating files below the target size.

iceberg_rewrite_data_files landed in duckdb/duckdb-iceberg#1035 and is not in a stable
duckdb release yet — requirements.txt pins duckdb==1.6.0.dev365 (it self-identifies as
v2.0.0-alpha), and the iceberg extension binary is keyed to the duckdb build, so pinning
duckdb pins the extension too.

Ported from djouallah/analytics-as-code scripts/compact_iceberg.py, which runs this against
an R2-backed catalog. Two things differ here:
  - Credentials. That catalog vends storage credentials (CREATE SECRET TYPE ICEBERG).
    OneLake is attached with access_delegation_mode 'none', so the client brings its own
    Azure token — the same azure secret + attach options dbt/profiles.yml uses.
  - No S3 uploader tuning. The reference sets s3_uploader_max_parts_per_file for R2's
    "non-trailing parts must be equal length" rule; OneLake writes go through the azure
    extension over abfss:// and never touch the S3 uploader.

Exactly one iceberg_metadata() call, in prime(). Do not add more — it enumerates every
manifest, which on a fragmented table is the whole problem we're here to fix.

Known limitations of the upstream function:
  - manifest-level column statistics are not populated for rewritten files
  - V3 tables and partition spec evolution are unsupported
  - there is no snapshot expiry, so the pre-compaction data files stay in OneLake until
    something expires them. Reads get faster immediately; storage does not shrink.

Never fails the pipeline: every table is best-effort and errors are printed, not raised, so
a bad run just means the tables stay fragmented until the next one.
