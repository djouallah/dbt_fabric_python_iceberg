-- Keyed merge on (date, time, DUID) so overlapping writers (6h CI cron + 12h Fabric
-- pipeline) upsert instead of double-appending; Iceberg has no enforced PKs, so truly
-- simultaneous commits still rely on the REST catalog's optimistic concurrency.
-- The full-rebuild branch regenerates every key and the merge replaces rows in place
-- (no TRUNCATE needed). Caveat: keys that drop out of a rebuild (e.g. a row newly
-- filtered by INITIALMW <> 0) linger until a `dbt run --full-refresh`.
